# Cpp Ray Tracing
A ray tracing study and test written by C++.<br>
Still studying, the code will be often updated.

## Compile
The program is compiled by `MinGW`. Please use `MinGW` to compile it if you want to save the time. IF YOU CAN, you can use other compiler.<br>
For most college students, they must have installed `Dev-C++` to study `C/C++`. If you did it, your computer have installed the `MinGW` in the `Dev-C++` installation path. If not, you can download it in its official website.<br>
Find the exe named `mingw32-make.exe` in the `MinGW` installation path. In my computer the path is `MinGW64/bin/mingw32-make.exe`. Please ensure the path is added to the `environment PATH`.<br>
After that, go to the program folder, open the command line and input like this:
```
$ mingw32-make
$ main
```
Wait a moment, after rendering you can find `test.png` in the folder.
  
## Feature
No complicated and new C++ feature, based on very easy C++.<br>
Be suitable for the people who know about C++, begin to study Ray Tracing.<br>
There is no comment in the code, I will add it in the future.
